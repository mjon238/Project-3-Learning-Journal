# Project-3-Learning-Journal

This assignment was alright, I'm glad we did it as a group and can't wait for the next assignment.
I do think we need to start planning ahead as I assume the final project may end up being quite difficult. 
I hope we do well overall as this is worth 30% of the final grade
